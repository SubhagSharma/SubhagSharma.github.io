I am a Master of Technology (M.Tech) candidate in Computer Science at the **Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Jammu**, with deep interests in **Medical Image Processing** and **Deep Learning**.

My research idealogy centers on and around **Efficiency in AI**—specifically, designing lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that can perform complex diagnostic tasks (like tumor segmentation or disease classification) on resource-constrained devices.
