I am a Master of Technology (M.Tech) candidate in Computer Science at the **Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Jammu**, specializing in **Medical Image Processing** and **Deep Learning**.

My research philosophy centers on **Efficiency in AI**—specifically, designing lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that can perform complex diagnostic tasks (like tumor segmentation or disease classification) on resource-constrained devices.

### 🎓 Education

| Degree | Institute | Performance | Year |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **M.Tech (CSE)** | IIT Jammu | **8.57 CGPA** | 2025 (Exp) |
| **B.Tech (CSE)** | SMVDU | **8.91 CGPA** | 2024 |

### 🔭 Current Focus
At IIT Jammu, I am researching advanced architectures for **Medical Imaging**. My goal is to bridge the gap between heavy, computational "black box" models and practical, deployable healthcare solutions.
